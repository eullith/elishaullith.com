                        Andragogy is the process by which adults learn. It is based on the premise that adults learn
                        best when they are actively engaged in the learning process. This implies that they must be
                        enthusiastic about what they are learning. They must also be able to apply what they have
                        learned to their own experiences and knowledge.
                    </h5>
                    <h5 class="portfolio-text">
                        Adults prefer to learn in their own pace and in their own way, which is an important aspect of
                        andragogy. They want to be able to immediately apply what they're learning in their lives.

                        To give a brief, andragogy is all about adults taking charge of their own learning, being
                        motivated and interested in what they're learning, connecting it to their own experiences, and
                        applying it to their lives.

                    <h5 class="pt-padding portfolio-text">
                        Malcolm Knowles is widely regarded as the father of andragogy, or adult learning theory and
                        practice. Knowles coined the term "andragogy" to describe the unique characteristics and needs
                        of adult learners in an article titled "Andragogy: The Adult Learner" in 1968.
                    </h5>
                    <h5 class="portfolio-text">
                        Prior to Knowles, adult education was frequently approached in the same way that children's
                        education was, with an emphasis on memorization and lecture-style teaching. Knowles, on the
                        other hand, believed that adult learners were unique and required a different approach.

                    <h5 class="instruction portfolio-text">
                        Andragogy, according to Knowles, is based on five key assumptions:

                                        John B. Watson was an influential American psychologist in the early twentieth
                                        century who believed that the study of consciousness was flawed and instead
                                        focused
                                        on observable behavior. He proposed a shift in the focus of psychology from the
                                        mind
                                        to behavior, which came to be known as behaviorism. Behaviorists studied learned
                                        behavior and its interaction with inborn qualities of the organism, commonly
                                        using
                                        animals in experiments. Tolman believed that everything important in psychology
                                        could be investigated through the continued experimental and theoretical
                                        analysis of
                                        the determiners of rat behavior.
                                    </p>
                                    Behaviorism dominated experimental psychology for several decades and has had a
                                    lasting influence. It established psychology as a scientific discipline through
                                    objective methods and experimentation and is still used in therapy and behavior
                                    modification. Behaviorism has also led to research on environmental influences on
                                    human behavior and is commonly used in classroom settings.

                                    <p>B.F. Skinner was a psychologist who studied how behavior is affected by the
                                        things
                                        that happen after it. He believed that rewards and punishments were very
                                        important
                                        in making us behave a certain way. Skinner made a special box called a Skinner
                                        box,
                                        which helps researchers study behavior. The box isolates the animal being
                                        studied
                                        and has a lever or button that the animal can push. When the animal pushes the
                                        lever
                                        or button, the box can give a reward like food or a punishment like a loud
                                        noise.
                                        This helps researchers understand how behavior can be changed by rewards and
                                        punishments.
                                    </p> Skinner was a psychologist who focused on how positive and negative
                                    reinforcement
                                    can influence behavior. This idea has had a big impact on psychology, but isn't used
                                    as much today with new research in cognitive psychology. However, people still use
                                    this method to change behavior. Skinner also wrote books about how his approach
                                    could make people happier, but not everyone agrees with his ideas.

                                        Behaviorism emphasizes the importance of reinforcement and punishment in shaping
                                        behavior. Caregivers can use this principle to encourage desired behaviors, such
                                        as taking medication on time or following a specific diet.

                                        Behavior therapy, which is based on the principles of behaviorism, has been used

                                        people, such as depression and anxiety.

                            The implications of behaviorism for instructional or learning design are significant. In
                            essence, it means creating effective learning experiences that includes behaviorist
                            principles. One important implication is that complex learning tasks must be broken down
                            into smaller, more digestible pieces. This can help learners increment their knowledge and
                            skills, maximizing their chances of success. Another implication is the importance of
                            providing both positive and negative feedback to help learners understand their progress and
                            areas for improvement. Furthermore, behaviorism focuses on the value of implementing a
                            number of interactive techniques, such as quizzes, simulations, and role-playing, to engage
                            and reinforce learners. Finally, behaviorism highlights the value of ensuring that students
                            can leverage their newly acquired knowledge in new and diverse situations.
